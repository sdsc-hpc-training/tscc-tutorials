# Introduction to Singularity: Containers for High-Performance Computing

## Thursday, March 21, 2019, 8:30am to 12:00pm, PST

This bootcamp provides an introduction to running Singularity containers on the SDSC 
Triton Shared Compute Cluster (TSCC) for users currently using the TSCC and those who want to 
know more about running Singularity on the TSCC. SDSC's computational scientist Marty Kandes 
provides an in-depth review of the important issues pertaining to running Singularity in the 
TSCC high-performance ecosystem and includes several useful container examples for you to explore.
