# Introduction to Introduction to Python for Data Scientists

## Thursday, May 16, 2019, 8:30am to 12:00pm, PST
## Presented by: Dr. Robert Sinkovits

The Python programming language provides an ideal platform for anyone who needs to work with data. The language itself is intuitive and flexible, but the full power of the Python ecosystem derives from the wide variety of packages available for doing everything from machine learning to data visualization. Using Jupyter Notebooks, we will start by introducing the basics of the language. Weâ€™ll then briefly touch on popular packages used for plotting (Matplotlib), data manipulation and analysis (pandas), numeric computing (NumPy) and machine learning (scikit-learn). Since the breadth of topics spans much more than we can fully covers in two hours, all materials are made available on GitHub so that attendees can continue learning on their own (https://github.com/sinkovit/PythonSeries).  

Training consists of a 1.5 hour presentation followed by a 2 hour Q&A/user support session, drop in users were welcome.

## Preparation Instructions:

The "Introduction to Python for Data Scientists" boot camp will cover a range of topics, including a brief overview of the Python programming language and the packages commonly used by data scientists.

Since the hands-on exercises are not computationally demanding and we want to make it easy for participants to work through the materials at their convenience, we are asking everyone to install Anaconda on their laptops and download the training materials in advance of the webinar.

1. Go to the Anaconda download page https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section, select your OS from the menu at the top of the page (Windows, macOS, Linux) and then download Python 3.7

2. Visit https://github.com/sinkovit/PythonSeries and download the repository.

During the workshop, we will explain how to install Anaconda on TSCC so that you can maintain your own instance and how to convert Python notebooks to standalone Python code suitable for batch computing.
